# Tracing UI

This is the frontend repo for my [data sorting visualization web app](https://visual-tracer-ag.herokuapp.com/). It was designed in React using the Material-UI library. This app is designed to help beginner CS students learn about sorting methods through visualization methods. During the 2019-2020 school year, it was implemented into my high school's CS curriculum and was officially introduced as a learning tool. It continues to be used today.
